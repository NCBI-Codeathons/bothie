99%-identity reads to Wuhan-SC2
-------------------------------

illumina iseq100 sequencing of sars-cov-2 but I only selected the reads that align with 1 mutation to the genome, to make the dataset a bit harder to search. (otherwise many reads map perfectly)
So, all reads have 1%-2% divergence to sars-cov-2 wuhan
